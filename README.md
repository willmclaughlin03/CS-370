Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I had to develop an intellegent agent capable of learning through deep Q-learning to play a treasure hunting game. I was given classes that stored episodes and the enviroment, as well as code that made the maze object. I created the deep-Q algorithm that helped the agent solve the game.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists create and analyze code to help solve problems in the world. Through this code they can change livesm provide jobs, and help humanity as a whole. This is why whar computer scientists do matters, because theu are able to solve unique problems to benefit the world.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Approaching problems as a computer scientist needs to be done carefully. Like solving a puzzle. Piece by piece, the problem becomes closer and closer to being solved, until it finally is, and you have your end goal.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization

To protect user information and interests, while writing code that doesn't harm or exploit anyone. Using common sense, figuring out what is right and wrong when it comes to development and user security is extremely important.
